# Task Challenge

This is a small app I made based on the [following specs](docs/specs.pdf).

## What's included

- Typescript
- Error handling
- Validations
- Uses [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) instead of redux for network request & state management
- Uses [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling & UI

## What's left

- Unit testing (not enough time ðŸ˜ž)
- Production Deployment
- CI/CD

## Setup

1. First & foremost, please clone this [repo](https://github.com/carlospugae/task-challenge-be) and follow the instructions to get it up & running.
2. Generate .env file by running the following command `cp .env.sample .env `
3. Run `npm -i` in order to install all dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to run the app.
5. Enjoy!
